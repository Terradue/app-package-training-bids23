This Python script is a command-line tool for performing a normalized difference operation on two input raster images. The normalized difference is commonly used in remote sensing and image processing to highlight certain features or properties in the images. 

Here's an overview of the script's functionality:

It imports necessary libraries and modules, including `click`` for defining a command-line interface, `numpy`` for numerical operations, `gdal` for geospatial operations, and `loguru` for logging.

The `normalized_difference` function is defined to perform the normalized difference operation. It takes two raster image file paths as input.

Inside the `normalized_difference` function, it logs the names of the input raster files.

It sets up `numpy` to allow division by zero and defines GDAL datasets for both input raster images.

The script creates a new output GeoTIFF file named `"norm_diff.tif"` to store the result. It preserves the geospatial information (geotransform and projection) from the first input raster.

It reads the pixel values from both input datasets and converts them to floating-point arrays.

It calculates the normalized difference as `(array1 - array2) / (array1 + array2)` and writes the result to the output dataset.

The output dataset is closed, and both input datasets are closed.

Finally, the script logs "Done!" to indicate that the operation is complete.

To use this script, one provides two input raster images as arguments. The script will calculate the normalized difference between the two images, save the result as `"norm_diff.tif"` and preserve the geospatial information from the first input image.
