This Python script is a command-line tool for applying the Otsu threshold to a raster image. The Otsu thresholding method is a technique used for image segmentation to separate objects of interest from the background. Here's an overview of the script's functionality:

It imports necessary libraries and modules, including click for defining a command-line interface, numpy for numerical operations, gdal for geospatial operations, skimage.filters for Otsu thresholding, and loguru for logging.

The threshold function takes a numpy array as input and returns the binary result of applying the Otsu threshold to the array. The Otsu threshold is calculated using the threshold_otsu function from the skimage.filters module.

The otsu function is defined to apply the Otsu threshold to the input raster image. It takes the path to the input raster as an argument.

Inside the otsu function, it logs the name of the input raster file.

It opens the input raster as a GDAL dataset and creates a new output GeoTIFF file named "otsu.tif."

The script sets the geospatial information (geotransform and projection) for the output dataset to match the input raster.

It reads the pixel values from the input dataset and converts them to a floating-point array.

The Otsu thresholding is applied to the array, and the binary result is written to the output dataset. The output dataset uses a data type of GDT_Byte.

The NoData value of the output dataset is set to 0.

The output dataset is closed, and the input dataset is closed.

Finally, the script logs "Done!" to indicate that the operation is complete.

To use this script, you would run it from the command line and provide the path to the input raster image as an argument. The script will apply the Otsu thresholding method to the input image, save the binary result as "otsu.tif," and preserve the geospatial information from the input image.

This script is useful for image segmentation tasks, such as separating objects from the background in remote sensing and image processing applications.
